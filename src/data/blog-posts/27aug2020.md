## Changes to the Website ðŸ› 

#### Themes ðŸ–Œ

I have removed individual customizable elements (Background and Text color), and I have replaced them with Themes. Right now, there are 4 themes.
List:

* Default (Zero Two wallpaper and Pink color)
* Big Sur (Big Sur wallpaper and Orange color)
* Aqua (Konosuba Aqua wallpaper and Blue color)
* Galaxy (Anime Galaxy wallpaper and Purple color)

#### Settings âš™

Previously, whenever you went into settings, there was a prompt. That wasn't very pretty and was difficult to use, especially on mobile. To fix that, I have added a menu that pops in whenever you press the setting button.

## Music ðŸŽµ

I have recently released 3 new songs (2 are just alternate versions of the 1st), all of which are a part of the `School` album. [Check it out here](https://soundcloud.com/exerraa)

## Movies ðŸŽ¬

I have recently gotten my hands on Hulu and HBO Max, and I want to know if anyone would be down to watch movies together. If you are interested, message me on Discord. My username: `Occult Waifu#1659`
