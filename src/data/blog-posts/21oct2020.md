# Personal Website 💻
I have completely overhauled my personal website. It is more modern looking, has more animations, and has my resume. You will also see my name in there 😛

# Minecraft Server ⛏

## What happened 😢
So... I accidentally nuked it. I made a duplicate server of it to test plugins. When I was done though, I wanted to delete it. The regular server was named "mcserver" and the duplicate was named "server". I typed in the command to permanently delete it, but since I was so used to typing "mcserver" I put that in and accidentally nuked the server. The duplicate wasn't usable though since I first tried to delete it through SFTP, but that was taking a while so I decided to use the command.

## The Future of the MC Server 🔮
Not all hope is lost though, I am making TWO (Yes, 2) servers in it's place. I cannot reveal details about that tho 😉


# What I have been doing these past few days 📚
