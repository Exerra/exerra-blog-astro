Hiya! This will have way more subjects than I usually do so lets get into it!

# Karen Bot 🤖

## Refractured code ⌨️

I changed how Karen Bot reads commands which was something I was putting off for a loooooong time 😅

Thankfully I only had to change around 50 files so it only took around a day 📆

With this way I have a way easier time managing permissions, command names (before they used to take the file name but now I can name the file however I want but it wont impact the command name), alias, better args handling and if a command fails it won't stop the whole bot, instead it would just not load the command 🥳

## NSFW AI ❌

So I have added a new feature to Karen Bot called AntiNSFW. If it is enabled, it scans every image uploaded and if the AI decides its a NSFW image and the channel is SFW it deletes the image

The AI is not mine so the service might cut me off 😟 (Let's hope they don't though!)

## Settings ⚙️

Speaking of enabled features, Karen Bot now has settings!

I will not spoil them all since most are in development but currently released are Welcome, AntiSwear, ModLog (for some moderation commands) and AntiNSFW.

## Guild backups ⛅️

I have started work on making Guild backups a thing for Karen Bot! Only server owners will be able to do that for quite obvious reasons but it would ensure a nice way to just have some peace in mind that when you accidentally click that delete button (looking at you *Brax*) you will be able to restore your work quite easily.

# API 🖨️

## Karen Bot 🤖

I have opened up the profile endpoints for restricted use! 😄

Yeah that's right. You need 24/7 profile hosting that is shared across multiple services? My API is the way to go then!

To apply, just shoot off a quick email to [karen@exerra.xyz](mailto:karen@exerra.xyz?subject=Applying%20For%20API) with the subject being "Applying For API" and the body being

> Project name: \[Project name]
>
>
> Project description: \[Project description]
>
>
> Where you want to use the API: \[Description of where you want to use the API]
>
>
> Project link/demo: \[Link to demo or code]
>
>
> Author GitHub: \[Twitter, GitHub]

(replace the stuff in \[] 😆)

It is a REST API using JSON.

## CDN 📄

I have created a CDN! The link is "[cdn.exerra.xyz/files/](https://cdn.exerra.xyz/files/)". I like to put mp4 memes there.

Now you may be wondering how this under the API section. "Shouldn't it be under some other section?" - You pondered while (hopefully) sipping some peach ice tea🍹

Well dear viewer, the reason is that I have made endpoints that a few select people have! I do not want to give them SSH access so I just made endpoints. Literally thats it. No, I did not spend 10 minutes trying to make one sentence entertaining, shut up.

# Websites 📑

## Documentation ✏️

I have made documentation for the API and commands page for Karen Bot. Both can be found [here](https://docs.karen.exerra.xyz)

## Status page ☠️

I have made a status page which has the status for all of my (public) projects!

It features a mailing list and automatic tweeting so when an incident happens it can automatically notify everyone interested (BTW [Follow me on Twitter please!](https://twitter.com/Exerra))

It can be found [here](https://status.exerra.xyz).

## Karen Bot 🤖

### Redesign 🖋️

I have started work on a redesign for Karen Bots website! It won't be available for a long time and I am not even sure if I will release it 😅

Also soon there will be a stats thingy added to the existing one

### Dashboard ⚙️

I have started work on a dashboard for Karen Bot that will let people toggle and change settings in a website! I need to figure out how to do Discord OAuth first though 👀

# Mail ✉️

Remember when I ranted about prices? Yeah me too

So lets-a jump into it! (You know like the stereotypical italian accent thingy? No? Ok fine)

So IMAP/POP is currently only supported in paid plans and I kind of really need it for newsletters and stuff so I have no choice but to get a paid plan.

I will choose the "Mail Lite" plan which offers quite 5GB of storage for every user and has all the stuff I would want (including custom login screen!!!!!) and it is 4,50€ a month for 5 users. With it I could finally start work on a newsletter. If you guys know of better services that maybe have more features or are cheaper (👀) then shoot a quick e-mail to [exerra@exerra.xyz](mailto:exerra@exerra.xyz)! (But like do not include Google)

# Stuff to expand my pea brain 🧠

I will start learning some JS frameworks that I don't know yet, maybe pick up some books about them idk.

I will also start focusing on Swift and maybe later learn Flutter just so I can make apps and stuff for mobile devices (Sadly no electron for mobile)
