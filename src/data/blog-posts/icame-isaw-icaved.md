This will be a bit of a more diverse post. I usually focus only on my coding stuff but right now I wanna experiment with a bit more personal stuff. So, uh, lets jump right into it?

# Websites

## Blog

So, the title of this post represents this. I caved into the analytics. Yes, for some time already this blog has analytics, bUt ThE reSuLTs mIgHt shOcK yOu!11!!!

So, I am pretty privacy oriented and I try to make my stuff like that aswell, so I haven't included Google Analytics in any of my websites for like over a year. This means that I had to figure out something else, but what could it be? Google Analytics features a robust dashboard with a lot of info, but it's Google! "Maybe there are other privacy oriented analytics websites around there? - Amelia thought to herself. "But what could it be?". Well, dear reader, the solution is a custom built analytics tool. This way I have absolutely complete control over the data that gets processed and stored. With other solutions I always felt like they could store data about \*you\* and that is not cool, your data needs to be protected! Thats why this video is sponsored by express vpn ;)

**Kidding, kidding** this blog has no sponsorships (sadly (companies give me money cmon)). Anyway I built a pretty simple analytics engine that quite literally just takes the slugs (aka the thing that comes after "domain.xyz/" and the platform (website, email, twitter, your mom in my bed and so on).

## Dont fear, Karen Bot is here! oh wait shes actually here help shes screaming at the manager oh god i need to leave now

Karen Bot will have a dashboard, hell yeah!

Oh and it's in a lot of guilds but thats more about the bot

# What's been happening the past few weeks

## Hackintosh

Hell yeah you heard it right! I'm making a hackintosh ðŸ˜Ž

So essentially what you need to know is that I am very smart and did it completely by myself with noooo outside help... oh who am I kidding of course I had help! [@MrGcGamer](https://github.com/MrGcGamer) helped me out a lot. They essentially redid my config and got rid of useless stuff. Without Gc, I couldn't even boot into the installer! Ikr, I need to get smorter on this topic immidiately!

Anyway jokes aside, Gc has been a massive help and I am very thankful about that ðŸ˜„

I have macOS installed on my laptop (which meant wiping the entire drive and reformatting to APFS with the GUID partition table, which means that RIP binbows but it was shit anyways) and some things are working, some are not but I can use macOS.

So I'ma list the things that currently work and don't work

**Working:**

* Backlight
* Webcam
* Audio (In and Out)
* Keyboard
* Battery sensort
* USB ports
* Probably some other stuff i forgot

**Not working:**

* Touchpad
* Wireless communications (Wi-Fi and Blueshi- sorry I accidentally coughed I meant Bluetooth)
* Closing the lid does nothing
* Fingerprint scanner (Although I think only Apple fingerprint scanners work, nothing else)

So overall, I need to desperately fix Touchpad and the lid, and then I can chill a bit and work on Wireless communications :)

Also apps like photoshop work flawlessly, so I will attach an image below

And as you can see, I of course went with the latest and greatest (public release), macOS Big Sur.

I am super excited about a portable music making and coding machine and I will keep everyone informed with the progression of this hackintosh ðŸ˜Š

## Swift

So, I've been learning Swift and SwiftUI, and I gotta say, it is super nice actually. It is quite a fun language and it is fun seeing your app come to life. I am working on a small invoice generation app that works both on macOS and iOS (although UI is much better on iOS), has Touch/Face ID on iOS and can even automatically e-mail the invoice to the client. Cool beans, but I won't attach a screenshot, sorry.
